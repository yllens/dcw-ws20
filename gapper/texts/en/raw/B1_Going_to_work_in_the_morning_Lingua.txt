My job is a long distance from my home, almost 50 miles away. I have to wake up early every morning, as I'm always in a rush. There's never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. At exactly 6:00 AM, I get into my car and start the long drive. I usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. During the morning rush hour, though, it's not very enjoyable. The heavy traffic is a little bit annoying. So I always listen to my favourite classical music CD's in the car - Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot.
