Wastage
occurs
throughout
the
production
and
distribution
cycle
,
during
production
,
during
transformation
,
during
transport
,
and
even
–
notably
in
developed
economies
–
after
purchase
by
the
final
customer
.
Fifty
percent
of
all
fruit
and
vegetables
going
to
waste
,
that
is
an
enormous
amount
of
wastage
,
and
not
just
in
economic
terms
.
This
wastage
has
a
huge
impact
in
terms
of
natural
resources
,
particularly
space
and
water
,
which
in
turn
have
huge
implications
for
the
global
environment
.
Cutting
out
all
waste
in
the
production
and
distribution
of
food
is
an
impossible
goal
.
Even
people
living
in
small
eco-sustainable
communities
generate
waste
.
