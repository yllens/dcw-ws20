At the end of the nineteenth century, an Englishman living in Brazil sent his son across the Atlantic to be educated in England. Charles Miller went t[gap]o[/gap] school, th[gap]en[/gap] to unive[gap]rsity[/gap], where h[gap]e[/gap] took pa[gap]rt[/gap] enthusiastically i[gap]n[/gap] all asp[gap]ects[/gap] of li[gap]fe[/gap]. Sport w[gap]as[/gap] one o[gap]f[/gap] them ; a hun[gap]dred[/gap] years a[gap]go[/gap], Britain alr[gap]eady[/gap] had a[gap]n[/gap] established spor[gap]ting[/gap] culture. Dur[gap]ing[/gap] his Eng[gap]lish[/gap] years, Charles grew passio[gap]nately[/gap] keen o[gap]n[/gap] football (i.e.s[gap]occer[/gap]), and wh[gap]en[/gap] in 18[gap]94[/gap] he pac[gap]ked[/gap] his ba[gap]gs[/gap] to ret[gap]urn[/gap] to his family in Brazil, among the things he took with him were half a dozen footballs. Back in Brazil, he tried to get other people interested in the game. At first he had little success; the only people who showed any interest were other expatriate Brits; thus the first game of football in Brazil was played between two teams of young Englishmen, on a field from which the goats had first been removed.
