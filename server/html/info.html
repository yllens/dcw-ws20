				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p><b>Group members:</b> Sarah and Nelly</p>

				<p>
				Data collection is an important aspect of linguistic research. In the field of linguistic
				complexity analysis in particular, especially important is the collection of data from human
				evaluators judging the complexity of a text. This can be used to supplement and provide a
				point of comparison with quantitative computational analysis. Using a survey-style web-based
				platform for such purposes would make the process more effective for the following reasons:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
					All of the data is collected in one place and organised in a consistent format,
					making it easier for the text evaluators to provide the required analysis and for 
					the researchers to efficiently process the feedback to extract relevant
					information and perform statistical analysis.
					</li>

					<li>
					A web-based platform is easily accessible by anyone with an internet connection
					and browser. This means that a wider range of evaluators can be reached,
					increasing the amount of data collected while still being able to sort it
					demographically (either using provided basic demographic data such as age, native
					language, or education level, or simply by restricting access to a certain group
					of people such as staff or students from a particular department in a university).	
					</li>

					<li>
					An online platform also allows researchers to be mindful of ethical issues, as the
					collected data can be anonymised and stored on a secure server.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
				Our goal is to implement an online survey platform for the collection of human judgements of
				the linguistic complexity of various texts. This platform will contain fields to collect
				basic demographic data about the evaluator, as well as the text to be analysed and fields 
				under each text for collecting answers to multiple choice questions regarding text
				difficulty.
				</p>

				<p>
				We will deploy a sample platform using texts (both paragraphs and individual sentences)
				extracted from corresponding standard and simple Wikipedia pages to gather data pertaining
				to human judgements of the difficulty of each text to see how much more complex the language
				used in standard Wikipedia is compared to simple Wikipedia. This data could then be used in
				an analysis of the linguistic complexity and readability of the two versions of Wikipedia to
				compare human judgements with computationally-calculated complexity scores.

				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
				The kinds of questions that we can include in the survey are:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Ranking of a single text</li>
					<li>Given that 1 = very easy and 10 = very difficult, how difficult is this text to read on a scale from 1-10?</li>
					<li>Ranking a set of given texts in order of how complex they are</li>
					<li>Multiple choice selection of vocabulary quality/variety measures</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The vocabulary that this text uses is:
								[very simple] [somewhat simple] [sophisticated] [very sophisticated]
							</li>
							<li>The range of vocabulary that this text uses is:
								[very limited (lots of repeated words)] [somewhat limited] [varied] [very varied]
							</li>	
						</ul>
					<li>Multiple choice selection of sentence complexity measures</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The sentence/s in this text is/are:
								[very simple] [somewhat simple] [complex (long, a lot of subordination, etc.)]
								[very sophisticated (very long, very complex syntactic constructions, etc.)]
							</li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
