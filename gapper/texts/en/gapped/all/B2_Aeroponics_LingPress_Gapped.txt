According to a United Nations FAO report published in 2011, almost half of the fruit and vegetables produced in the world go to waste – they never get consumed by the humans for whom they are grown. Wastage occ[gap]urs[/gap] throughout t[gap]he[/gap] production a[gap]nd[/gap] distribution cy[gap]cle[/gap], during produ[gap]ction[/gap], during transfo[gap]rmation[/gap], during tran[gap]sport[/gap], and ev[gap]en[/gap] – notably i[gap]n[/gap] developed econ[gap]omies[/gap] – after purc[gap]hase[/gap] by t[gap]he[/gap] final cust[gap]omer[/gap]. Fifty per[gap]cent[/gap] of a[gap]ll[/gap] fruit a[gap]nd[/gap] vegetables go[gap]ing[/gap] to wa[gap]ste[/gap], that i[gap]s[/gap] an enor[gap]mous[/gap] amount o[gap]f[/gap] wastage, a[gap]nd[/gap] not ju[gap]st[/gap] in econ[gap]omic[/gap] terms. Th[gap]is[/gap] wastage has a huge impact in terms of natural resources, particularly space and water, which in turn have huge implications for the global environment. Cutting out all waste in the production and distribution of food is an impossible goal. Even people living in small eco-sustainable communities generate waste. Even in organic crop production, pests and disease cause wastage; and even if harvested and distributed locally, part of a crop will always be wasted.
