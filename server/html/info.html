				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>
				Data collection is an important aspect of linguistic research. In the field of linguistic
				complexity analysis in particular, especially important is the collection of data from human
				evaluators judging the complexity of a text. This can be used to supplement and provide a
				point of comparison with quantitative computational analysis. Using a survey-style web-based
				platform for such purposes would make the process more efficient for the following reasons:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
					All of the data is collected in one place and organised in a consistent format,
					making it easier for the text evaluators to provide the required analysis and for 
					the researchers to efficiently process the feedback to extract relevant
					information and perform statistical analysis.
					</li>

					<li>
					A web-based platform is easily accessible by anyone with an internet connection
					and browser. This means that a wider range of evaluators can be reached,
					increasing the amount of data collected while still being able to sort it
					demographically (either using provided basic demographic data such as age, native
					language, or education level, or simply by restricting access to a certain group
					of people such as staff or students from a particular department in a university).	
					</li>

					<li>
					An online platform also allows researchers to be mindful of ethical issues, as the
					collected data can be anonymised and stored on a secure server.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
				Our goal is to implement an online survey platform for the collection of human judgements of
				the linguistic complexity of various C-test testlets. This platform will contain fields to collect
				basic demographic data about the evaluator, as well as the text to be analysed and fields 
				under each text for collecting answers to multiple choice questions regarding text
				difficulty.
